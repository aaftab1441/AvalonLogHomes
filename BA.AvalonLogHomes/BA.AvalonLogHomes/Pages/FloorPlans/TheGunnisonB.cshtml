        The Gunnison B
    </h1>
    <p>This <a href="http://www.gravitaslc.com/">Gravitas, Inc. Series</a> Gunnison B is a modification to a plan that we made in 2006. A client wanted to change the home to have the garage attached. This makes for a different mud room entry into the kitchen.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1515909134279">The Gunnison: 3D Fly-Around Video</a></h2>
    <p>This is a classic prow layout that we are all familiar with but with a more contemporary entry and steeply pitched roofs. The Upper Level has a large bunk room and then opens up to a Flex Space that could be a home office or an additional suite. Take a walk through and let us know what you think.</p>

        2,411 square feet total.
