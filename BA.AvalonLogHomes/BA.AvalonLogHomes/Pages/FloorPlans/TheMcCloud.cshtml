        The McCloud
    </h1>
    This Gravitas, Inc. Series McCloud is a 3689 SF, three bedroom, three bath home with a two car garage. A traditionally 2x6 framed home with log siding and log accents, the McCloud has all the appearance of a log home but with a more traditional interior. This comfortable home has three full suites, each having their own bathroom, two of which have "his and hers" sinks. The home's footprint is extended with a large screened porch for evening dinners and then out to an open air deck with a hot tub.
