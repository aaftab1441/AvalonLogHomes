        The Oak Crest reflects the very best in contemporary design. This log cabins plan features a 3 Bdrm, 2 Bath, formal dining room, single level with garage with Optional Bonus Room. The spacious energy efficient kitchen with adjacent nook opens into the backyard creating the perfect setting for family gatherings. Totally separate from the well designed public area is the bedroom wing. The master bedroom features a beautifully appointed bath area. There is a masterful sense of styling clearly evident in spaciousness and design that you will appreciate for a long time.
