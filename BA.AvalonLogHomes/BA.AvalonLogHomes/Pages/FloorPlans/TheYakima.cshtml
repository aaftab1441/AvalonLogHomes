    <p>The Yakima is a unique plan that incorporates three separate Owner's Suites, which works well for integrated family living, or as a vacation rental. Each Owner's Suite also has a private deck or balcony for creating a strong indoor-outdoor connection. It also has a large home office making for a short commute to work. This additional area could easily be converted into a separate apartment with a private entrance, or to additional bedrooms for the home. Not shown is the Lower Level below the Gathering Room with a small Rec. Room, 1/2 Bath and Mechanical Room. A large Kitchen with oversized bar seating and attached Sun Room and Dining make for a great entertaining area.</p>
